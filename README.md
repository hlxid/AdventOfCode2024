# Advent of Code 2024

[![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-rust-red)](https://rust-lang.org/)

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2024 challenges.
For more information visit: https://adventofcode.com/2024/about

The solutions to the days can be run using `cargo run -p dayxy` (e.g. `-p day01`) and a new day can be generated by running `cargo run -p add-day`.

The puzzle inputs are only encrypted inside this repository because of the various discussions about whether the inputs should be public or not inside the AoC community over the recent years.
Unit tests are done using the public example given with each task.
The solution is run with my own puzzle input in CI to verify it is working, but the input and solutions are not revealed.
